# GenChromatographyResin Workflow
This workflow generates the atomistic representation of a polymer netowrk through coarse-grained 3D printing protocol, followed by the CG-to-All-Atom conversion.

This workflow is used to generate polymer network structures in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2024.465089.
